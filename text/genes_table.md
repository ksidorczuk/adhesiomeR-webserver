This table contains information about all adhesin genes collected in adhesiomeR
database. Description of the table contents is given below: 

**System**: indicates name of the system to which a gene belongs. For fimbrial 
adhesins, it is a whole operon (or multiple operons in some cases) encoding all 
subunits needed for assembly of given fimbriae. For nonfimbrial adhesins, it is
the name of a protein product. 

**Gene**: gene name

**Accession**: accession number of a sequence corresponding to a gene in our
database

**Function/Class**: information about function or class of a gene. Annotations
may include following classes: adhesion, assembly ATPase, autotransporter, 
chaperone, inner membrane protein, invasin, linker element, major subunit, 
minor subunit, nucleator, outer membrane protein, prepilin peptidase, 
putative nucleaotide-binding protein, regulatory, structural, termination subunit,
unknown, usher. 

**References**: reference for sequence accession source or function/class annotation
