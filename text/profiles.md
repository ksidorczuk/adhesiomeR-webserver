Here you can see assignment of analysed genomes to adhesin profiles. 

A **profile** is defined as a unique pattern of adhesin gene presence/absence. 

We investigated adhesin profiles using three types of gene subsets, (i) all – using all adhesin genes, 
(ii) fimbrial – considering only genes encoding fimbrial adhesins, (iii) nonfimbrial – based on genes 
encoding nonfimbrial adhesins. For each of these subsets, we define profiles as unique patterns of gene 
presence/absence and we number them from the most frequently occurring to the rarest ones. For profiles 
based on all, fimbrial and nonfimbrial subsets of genes, the profile number is preceded by ‘A-’, ‘F-’ and ‘N-’ correspondingly.

**NA** means that we did not identify profile matching the data.
