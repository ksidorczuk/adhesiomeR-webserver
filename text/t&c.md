**WHO WE ARE AND HOW TO CONTACT US**

https://adhesiomer.quadram.ac.uk is a service operated by the Hildebrand group, within Quadram Institute Bioscience.

To contact us, please email falk.hildebrand@quadram.ac.uk

The adhesiomeR web server allows running small analyses up to xxx genome assemblies. It offers calculation of gene and system presence/absence, determination of adhesin profiles and clusters. A wide selection of charts allows for a visual inspection of results. The generation of HTML reports increase the reproducibility of adhesiomeR analysis. For a more customizable workflow on larger genome sets, pangenomes or gene catalogues, we provide an adhesiomeR standalone R package.

This includes, without limitation, analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our service.

**WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA**

Information which you provide to us will ordinarily be stored on our secure servers. However, we do work with third party contractors, some of whom host and operate certain features of the web service. Accordingly, information that we collect from you may be collected in or transferred to a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”).

That information may be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our contractors. Bear in mind that countries outside the EEA do not always have strong data protection laws. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing and processing.

We may disclose your personal information to third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share such information in order to comply with any legal obligation or to protect the rights, property or safety of Quadram Institute Bioscience, its members or others.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet is completely secure. We therefore cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our service, and any transmission is at your own risk. However, once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access, unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our service, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
