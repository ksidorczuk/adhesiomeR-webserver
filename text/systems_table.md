This table contains general information about systems collected in adhesiomeR
database. Description of each column content is given below.

**System**: name of the system.

**Alternative names**: some adhesins, especially fimbrial, might have been described
and known by multiple names. We note them here to provide comperehensive information
about each of the systems and allow easier analysis of the results. 

**Type**: Fimbrial for adhesins forming organelles composed of multiple subunits 
or Nonfimbrial for adhesins encoded by single genes, mainly autotransporters. 

**Morphology**: Describes morphology of the fimbrial adhesins. Considered types
include: fimbrial - form long, thread-like organelle structures, afimbiral - create 
amorphous outer-membrane associated sheaths, fibrillar - create very fine wiry 
structures in which some individual filaments could be rarely resolved,
helical - formed by two fibrils arranged in a double helix with thinner, more 
flexible and more open structure than fimbriae. 


**Biosynthesis/Secretion pathway**: indicates biosynthesis or secretion pathway
leading to assembly or release of functional protein/organelle. For autotransporters, 
also indicates if it belongs to subfamily of self-associating autotransporters
(SAAT) or family of Serine Protease Autotransporters of Enterobacteriaceae (SPATE).
May include: Chaperone-usher, Nucleation/precipitation, T5aSS; SPATE, T5aSS; SAAT,
T5cSS, T5eSS, T3SS; T5eSS, T2SS, T5bSS, Type IV pilus.

**Description**: a very short description of a system.
